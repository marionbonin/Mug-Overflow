## The Project

### Introduction

At the end of our 6-month intensive fullstack web development course at O'Clock school, we worked as a team of 5 developers (3 front-end devs, 2 back-end devs) on this project.  
Our product owner [Albert Bru](https://github.com/AlbertBRU) came up with the project idea a couple of months ago, when all students received a randomly designed mug as a welcome gift at the beginning of the course.
> _Why couldn't students browse, choose and order their own mug(s) among the O'Clock collection?_  
> _What if the students, but also the school staff could order a new mug if their first one's been broken or lost?_

From there, we took the end-of-studies project as an opportunity to rethink what was originally a private joke among O'clock students, and bring it to life!

### Duration & organisation

* Total duration: 1 month
* Organisation: working with the Agile Metholody (SCRUM), the project was split into four 1-week sprints detailed below.
  * Sprint 0: Defining together (back & front devs) the scope of the project, the specs, the technos and tools to be used; creating lo-fi and mid-fi wireframes, routes calatog, app routes & MCD.
  * Sprint 1: Static integration of all the pages with React & Material UI framework.
  * Sprint 2: Dynamising the website with the data fetched from the API endpoints provided by the backend.
  * Sprint 3: Debugging, fixing, improving UI; "cleaning" the code & preparing the final live demo.

### Contributors:

* The frontend was coded by [Albert Bru](https://github.com/AlbertBRU), [Andrei Dragomir](https://github.com/Andrei0Dragomir) and myself.
